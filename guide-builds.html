        <h3>Three Pillars of a Build</h3>
        <p class="mt-1"><strong style="color:var(--accent-gold);">Equipment</strong> — The weapon, armor, and ring you're using.</p>
        <p class="mt-1"><strong style="color:var(--accent-gold);">Enchantments</strong> — Abilities on your equipment, up to 3 per piece (4 total with legendaries).</p>
        <p class="mt-1"><strong style="color:var(--accent-gold);">Permanent Boosts</strong> — Separate bonuses you invest BP into. Found in the fourth tab of the analysis book. BP can be reallocated by watching an ad.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Supplemental reading: <a href="guide-stats.html">Stats for Dummies</a></p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mb-3">
        <h3>General Principles</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">The goal is always to make your <strong>defense higher than the enemy's attack</strong> and your <strong>attack higher than the enemy's defense</strong>.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">Add HP as needed with 1-2 enchantments to stay alive while taking minimal damage. Fine stat adjustments can be made with BP if necessary, but prioritize other boosts.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">In M1+, flat stat bonuses tend to be better than training enchantments (use Strength over Strength Training, Sturdy over Defense Training, etc.).</p>
        <p class="mt-1">Analysis is important — achieving high analysis levels on your equipment unlocks powerful bonuses, especially going into M1+.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mb-3" style="border-left:3px solid var(--accent-teal);">
        <h3>M0 (Pre-Miasma)</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Pick up and use whatever gives the most ATK or DEF. Don't forget to upgrade your gear — even a Wooden Stick or Short Sword will serve as a decent weapon if you evolve it enough.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">Upgrade value can be transferred via silver essence synthesis, so you aren't losing anything by using hardeners. Though upgrade value spent to evolve equipment is lost.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">Training enchantments tend to be much better here, as they scale up much more quickly relative to higher enchantment levels.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">Monsters are weak enough that their damage can be reduced to 1-5 with enough defense. BP will have minimal effect at this stage, but throw it all in STR.</p>
        <p class="mt-2" style="color:var(--accent-gold);">Goal: Get through M0 Magic Castle of the End to spread miasma through the world.</p>
        <p class="mt-1 text-muted">Castle boss stats: HP 2,000 | STR 2,100 | DEF 900 | SPD 1</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mb-3" style="border-left:3px solid var(--type-weapon);">
        <h3>M1-5</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">You now have access to corrosion levels, giving you the opportunity to make significantly stronger setups. What equipment you use is less important than the bonuses provided by corrosion and upgrade level.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">Equipment with more abilities becomes more common. Try to switch to gear with higher corrosion and more ability slots, but at some point just pick something and keep investing into it.</p>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Consider synergies</strong> between weapon, shield, and ring. Upon reaching high enough analysis and corrosion on any weapon, you gain access to a set bonus that activates by equipping both the weapon and the indicated ring or shield.</p>
        <p class="mt-1 text-muted">Analysis Lv9 & Corrosion 200: STR Boost +0.5</p>
        <p class="mt-1 text-muted">Analysis Lv13 & Corrosion 400: STR Boost +0.5</p>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Attack type rings</strong> provide significant strength boosts for matching weapon types:</p>
        <p class="mt-1 text-muted">Slashing: Ring of Power, Fairy Ring | Bludgeoning: Black Box, Copper Ring, Glazed | Projectile: Search Ring, Silver Ring | Piercing: Mobius Ring, Summon Ring</p>
        <p class="mt-2" style="background:var(--bg-surface);padding:0.75rem;border-radius:var(--radius-md);">
          <strong style="color:var(--accent-gold);">RECOMMENDED:</strong> If you get First Strike, go all in on ATK. Stack attack with strength enchantments, weapon upgrades, and attack type damage BP. First Strike lets you attack first every combat, so you just need enough to one-shot everything.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mb-3" style="border-left:3px solid var(--type-ring);">
        <h3>M6+</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Higher corrosion levels, equipment rarity, and enchantment levels. This is where <strong>elite monsters</strong> are introduced.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">Elite tiers: <span style="color:#3b82f6;">Alpha (blue)</span>, <span style="color:#eab308;">Bloody (yellow)</span>, <span style="color:#ef4444;">Chaos (red)</span>, <span style="color:#94a3b8;">Dread (gray)</span>, <span style="color:#a855f7;">Eternal (purple)</span></p>
        <p class="mt-1">Higher tier elites resurrect upon death: Bloody/Chaos once, Dread twice, Eternal three times. This is where HP and dodge rate become more important.</p>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Recommended BP priority:</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-1">1. Sixth Sense (50bp) + Seven Blessings (50bp) for dodge</p>
        <p class="mt-1">2. Add 1 Agility enchantment when it gets you 8,000 agility (analyze your ring for all stat boost)</p>
        <p class="mt-1">3. At 16,000 agility, you can remove BP from Sixth Sense</p>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Damage sources:</strong> Put BP into attack type permanent boost (slashing, etc.) — generally better than putting points in STR unless your ATK is only barely above monster DEF.</p>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Crits:</strong> Put BP into One Strike (50bp), Seven Blessings (50bp), Three Paths (50bp), Critical Hit Rate (max 250bp), Critical Hit Damage (max 300bp), in that order.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card mb-3" style="border-left:3px solid var(--accent-gold);">
        <h3>Illusory Royal Tomb</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">Largely the same strategy as M6+. Fewer reviving enemies, but still present near the end. Enemy stats increase infinitely as you progress, so at some point you'll have to stop and grind.</p>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Enchantment builds:</strong></p>
        <p class="mt-1 text-muted">Option A: 4 STR, 3 VIT, 1 HP, 1 AGI</p>
        <p class="mt-1 text-muted">Option B: 3 STR, 1 STR Training, 2 VIT, 1 VIT Training, 1 HP, 1 AGI</p>

      <div class="card mb-3">
        <h3>Note on Rings</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">The strength rings are generally best, but in reality you want the ring that benefits the stat you have the most of. Against Orochi you may need more HP than STR so an HP ring could be better.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">Because the stat distribution of monsters in M1-100 and tomb tends to favor an even split between ATK and DEF, strength becomes the best option for these areas.</p>

        <h3>Getting Stronger Checklist</h3>
